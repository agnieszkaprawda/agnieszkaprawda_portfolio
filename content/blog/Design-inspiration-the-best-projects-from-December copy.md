We spent 36 h working on the creation of the MVP - including the development of the UI & UX, logistics behind the product, ways of gaining revenue, and coding the backend & frontend of the app.

We came up with an idea related to enabling young people to socialize during COVID-19 times.

Within a few hours, we managed to conduct the survey and get 54 responses that confirm the viability of our idea.

It was an absolute pleasure to work with such fantastic, creative, and open people! Thank you so much team once again for making this experience so priceless and amusing!
